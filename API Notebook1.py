# # Learning to use APIs
# 
# #### Welcome to the first workshop on APIs!
# 
# Note: Depending on your programming journey, a lot of this may seem new. My advice is:
# 
# 1. Don't panic.
# 2. Read the code - then read the documentation. Google anything weird.
# 3. Comment wherever you can to secure learning or question unknowns.
# 4. Take. It. Slow. Remember the time frame.
# 5. Persevere and revisit independently - treat this notebook like a reference and a starting point.

# ## Contents
# In this workshop, we will:<b>
# 
# - [Import](#import) the required packages
# - [How does the internet work?](#internet)
# - [GET](#get) data by sending a request
# - [Authenticate](#auth) using an API Key 
# 
# 
# </b>

# <a id="import"></a>
# # Import packages and read data
# [Back to Contents](#Contents)
# 
# First, we will import the packages that we will need later. In this case, there are three:
# - **requests**: a package for sending API requests
# - **pandas**
# - **json**: a package for interpreting JSON data
# 
# 
# The syntax for importing a package is:
# > <span style="color:blue">\# *Import the xxx package*</span><br>
# <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">import</span> xxx <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">as</span> x 

# In[1]:


# Import the requests, pandas and json packages

import requests
import pandas as pd


# In[2]:


#Import the requests, pandas and json packages
import requests
import pandas
import json

# <a id="internet"></a>
# # How does the internet work?
# [Back to Contents](#Contents)
# 
# The internet is made up of millions of computers connected together. Some computers are configured to respond to requests by sending a packet of information. 
# 
# A good example of this is a webpage. When you go to a URL, your computer sends a request to the server computer at that address.
# 
# 
# 
# 

# ![Request.PNG](attachment:Request.PNG)
# 
# The server sends a response to your request. That response is html code:
# 
# ```html
# <html lang="en" dir="ltr"><head>
#     <meta charset="utf-8">
#     <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
#     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
# 
#     <meta name="defaultLanguage" content="en">
#     <meta name="availableLanguages" content="en, es, fr, ja, pt_BR, uk, el, de, zh_Hans, zh_Hant, ru, he, eo">
#     <title>requests Â· PyPI</title>
#     <meta name="description" content="Python HTTP for Humans.">
# ```
# 
# Your computer then processes the html code to display the website.

# 
# ### What is an API?
# 
# An API is a set of dedicated URLs (or more generally URIs) that return pure data responses, usually in JSON format.
# 
# For more detailed information, see this article from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-an-api-in-english-please-b880a3214a82/).

# <a id="get"></a>
# # GET data by sending a request
# [Back to Contents](#Contents)
# 
# In the first example, we will send a get request to the server at the address https://api.publicapis.org/entries and look at the response it sends.
# 
# Task: take some time to explore the API documentation on [https://api.publicapis.org](https://api.publicapis.org).

# In[3]:


# Send a get request to https://api.publicapis.org/entries and record the response 
# to a variable called response

url = 'https://api.publicapis.org/entries'
response = requests.get(url, verify=False)


# ![picno1.png](attachment:picno1.png)

# In[4]:


#type the above code in the cell and run it
response


# In[5]:


# Print the response text below. You will need to use a print statement for this. 
# The output should look something like the below.
#Refer to the documentation or use Google if needed.
print(response.content)


# ![picno2.png](attachment:picno2.png)

# The response came in as data in a **JSON** format.
# 
# **JSON** is a common format for the exchange of data between applications. It consists of key-value pairs and lists:
# 
# ```python
# ["Cats","Dogs","Elephants"]
# {"Content":"Image", "Name":"Cats", "Description":"kittens playing in a garden"}
# ```
# 
# Lists are denoted by square brackets `[` `]` and key-value pairs by curly brackets `{` `}`. Elements are separated by commas.
# 
# In the response, we have a key-value pair:
# - `"count":1084` is the number of APIs in the dataset
# - `"entries":[...]` is a list of entries in the dataset
# 
# Each entry in the dataset is then given key-value pairs:
# - `"API": "Axolotl"`
# - `"Description":"Collection of axolotl pictures and facts"`
# - `"Auth":""`
# - `"HTTPS":true`
#  - `"Cors":"yes"` 
#  - `"Link":"https://theaxolotlapi.netlify.app/"`
#  - `"Category":"Animals"`
#  
#  To convert the data in the entries list into a pandas DataFrame, we first load the text into a python dictionary.
#  
#  The syntax for loading a JSON string into a python dictionary is:
#  > json.loads(json_string)
#  
# Here, **json**.*loads()* refers to the *loads()* function in the **json** package and *json_string* is the string to be converted into a dictionary.

# ![picno3.png](attachment:picno3.png)

# In[6]:


#type the above code and run it
data = response.json()
data


# ![picno5.png](attachment:picno5.png)

# In[7]:


#type the above code here
df = pd.json_normalize(data, record_path = 'entries')
df.head()


# In[17]:


#Use the groupby function to see what categories are available. You will need to count these and sort in descending order.
#The output should look like the following cell below.
#Refer to the documentation for help, or if really stuck ask your PDE.
df[['Category','API']].groupby('Category').count().sort_values(by = 'API', ascending = False)


# ![picno6.png](attachment:picno6.png)

# <a id="auth"></a>
# # Authenticate an API
# [Back to Contents](#Contents)
# 
# In this example, we will take [TicketMaster](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/getting-started/) and use the API to find out about events in London.
# 
# Task: Open the website associated with the URL and find the documentation. Take some time to explore the API documentation.

# ![ticketmaster.PNG](attachment:ticketmaster.PNG)
# 
# We will navigate the documentation to find out how to use the API. In the documentation, it lists the data model and the URI format.

# ![tm_URI.PNG](attachment:tm_URI.PNG)

# For this example, we need to use the discovery package. Click on **Discovery API** to find out more information about it.
# 
# ![ticketmaster_discovery.PNG](attachment:ticketmaster_discovery.PNG)

# To access this API, we will need to set up a login and create an API key.
# 
# Task: Set up a log in on the ticketmaster developer website.
# 
# Task: Log in and get your Consumer Key.

# ![picno7.png](attachment:picno7.png)

# In[27]:


#Type the above code in the relevant cells
#HappyI-App
base_url = 'http://app.ticketmaster.com/discovery/v2'
endpoint = '/events'
api_key = 'Aio1QzB6GGWYR0IJvqy05obAPhwzvPnU'
url = base_url + endpoint +'.json?' + 'city=London&' +'apikey=' + api_key 
url


# ![picno8.png](attachment:picno8.png)

# In[28]:


#Type the above code
response = requests.get(url, verify=False)


# In[29]:


# Convert the response text into a python dictionary
print(response.text)


# ![picno9.png](attachment:picno9.png)

# In[32]:


new = response.json()


# In[34]:


new1 = pd.json_normalize(new['_embedded']['events'])
